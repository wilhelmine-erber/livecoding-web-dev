## UIB - UI/UX - Live Coding 04

### Overview

Introduction to the use of the `box-shadow` (drop shadow) property and its application in UI design. This live - coding demonstrates general use of the property, creating a 'well component', using multiple shadows, and several use cases where it would be appropriate to add depth to a webpage.

### Main Concepts

- Understanding of X and Y offsets, blur, spread radius and color
- Subtlety is key, less is more
- Making things easy with a **box-shadow generator** (link below)
- Creative uses of `box-shadow` with `:hover`
