## UIB - UI/UX - Live Coding 03

---

### Overview

First introduction to the complexities of working with color in UI design. We will look at the color wheel to choose complementary colors, accents and hues as well as creating a color palette to use in projects. We'll design a small 'real world' component to demonstrate how important the use of color is to make a professional and engaging UI.

### Main Concepts

- Introducing the **color wheel**
- The importance of using complementary colors, hues and accents in UI design
- You need more colors than you think!
- Using shades of gray rather than true black / white
- Best practices - defining a dominant color, red is for destructive actions, yellow for a warning message
- Stressing the importance of how proper color management can professionalize our project
