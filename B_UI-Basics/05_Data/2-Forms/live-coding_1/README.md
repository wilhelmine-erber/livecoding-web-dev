### Overview

First look at working with dynamic data in `HTML` forms. We will review `HTTP` verbs, actions, methods and wire up a basic contact form with [formspree](https://formspree.io/) to obtain a fuller understanding of the process.

### Main Concepts

- Proper `HTML` structure of a form - `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<input>`, `<checkbox>`
- Importance of the many attributes associated with forms
- Accesibility in form creation
- Making choices - radio and checkboxes
- Using **formspree** to collect our data
