## Overview

This is an example of advanced form styling where we will create a very simple form that implements a custom, animated radio input. Several of the techniques used in this creation (`transition`, relative positioning) have not yet been introduced in the course. These can be explained in relation to this project with the assurance that they will be more fully introduced later in the curriculum.

## Main Concepts

- Applying advanced, custom styling to provide a more interesting and engaging UI for the user
- Creating a custom animation on a radio button to personalize our design
