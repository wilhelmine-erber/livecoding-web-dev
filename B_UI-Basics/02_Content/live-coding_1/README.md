### Overview

This is a further demonstration of heading and paragraph tags as well as linking our stylesheet to an HTML document to apply color rules. Lorem Ipsum, ordered and unordered lists, and the concept of nesting are also introduced.

### Main Concepts

- External, internal and inline CSS
- Using Lorem Ipsum for dummy text
- Deconstructing the CSS rule
- Use cases for ordered and unordered lists
- Nesting
