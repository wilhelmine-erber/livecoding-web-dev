# UI Basics

**DCI Web Development**

**Live Coding and Materials** 


This repository contains live coding examples and additional reference materials covering the entirety of the 8 week **UI Basics** module.

The material is divided into the following submodules:

- [01_Boilerplate](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/01_Boilerplate)
- [02_Content](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/02_Content)
- [03_Box Model](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/03_Box-Model)
- [04_UI/UX](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/04_UI-UX)
- [05_Data](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/05_Data)
- [06_Responsiveness](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/06_Responsiveness)
- [07_Layout](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/07_Layout)
- [08_Interactions](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/08_Interactions)
- [09_Frameworks](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/09_Frameworks)
- [10_Publishing](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-livecoding/tree/master/B_UI-Basics/10_Publishing) 

## Overview 

Each **submodule directory** is further divided into several `live-coding` directories, each containing an individual `README.md` noting the specific part of the curriculum the example refers to, main concepts that need to explained and demonstrated in the lesson and links to reference materials online that can be referenced by the trainer and shared with students.

### Additional Materials

Additionally, a directory of **additional materials** can be found inside of each **submodule directory** containing slides and presentations on the topic. These can be used in conjunction with the live coding or presented beforehand when a more theoretical introduction is preferred. Several presentations that don't necessarily warrant live coding examples (**Intro to Accessibilty**, **Responsive Design**, **Understanding the Cascade**) can be accessed in the [curriculum slides repository](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/web-dev-v3-slides/tree/master/B_UI-Basics) or in the [curriculum content skeleton](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBfGamImW3XQj_ol781gE2SXjbe8WPfToh8Ib86weAQ/edit?pli=1#gid=0).

### Use Cases

The **UI/UX**, **Layout**, and **Interactions** submodules also contain a directory titled `use-cases`. These directories each contain several small 'projects' that can be live coded to give the students a fuller understanding of the topic and a 'real world' demonstration of how the learned material can be applied in the context of building a professional website or application. Each particular **use case** is fairly simple and should not take more than 1 teaching unit (90 minutes) to complete.
